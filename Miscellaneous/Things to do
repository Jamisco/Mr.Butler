For each coupon button, add a means to scroll infinitely and see coupons
    - for example, I wanna scroll through hot coupons endlessly and see a list of empty coupons
        denoting a coupon add. Each box of the coupon must be numbered, so coupon 1, 2, 3, 4 .... 100 etc
    
Now add functionality for each coupon box,
    - SO lets make the red squares actually look like coupon
        - for example,the squares will have pictures, text etc
        - the squares must also be clickable to bring up more info about the coupon in another screens
            - from here we can begin thinking about scraping actual coupons from the web

10/11/21 - 10:04pm - done

    - find a way to pass the navigation props to the coupon load so we can click on the mini coupon ad and navigate
      to the coupon screens

    - Case Banana
        - Case Banana will be a program that will scan and collect the product information from grocery stores such as 
            family, sams club or costco

        - The program will acquire the picture, price and product description of items and store them in their
          respective files.

        - Case Banana aint going so well, Damn Dynamic webpages making life too hard, Ive got 1 more trick up my sleeve
          if that fails, then we do it the good old fashioned way, I will either

          - manually copy and paste the html into a file and parse it using the Html parser
            - images have a source property, which is pretty much a link, so we can use that accordingly
          - copy and paste the pictures and text and create some sort of JSON for this program to use from there

        - Never mind i figured it out and got it working, lets see what I can do with this
    - 10/27/21 - 3:45am 
      - Case Banana Accomplished - We got the info for Family Dollar Detergents, 
        - for now the program only works for Family dollar, but we can easily modify it for other stores

Now begin implementing the data and pictures retrieved from Case Banana into the program accordingly
  - All data has been successfully implemented

  1/20/22 - 9:21pm

    - The current objective is the find a way to load the coupons from Family Dollar onto the app
      - Perhaps if possible hold a database for such things

      - Please be aware, your objective is not to simply scrap the coupons off the website, although we might
        have to do that,
          - also you cant scrap coupons off coupons.com and shit, hella illegal. They own those coupons

    - Best way, to go about this.... make it possible to sign in with an account - say google account,
      then  .... ehh maybbe in the future

    - Best bet, call the companies and ask them to send you the coupons so you can distribute them
     - we can start with Chris,
        - In the mean while scrap it, and test it - we are permitted to use for personal and noncommerical use

    - Alright fuck this objective, I have decided its stupid

    - Create registration screen
       - done
    - Now make registration screen work with firebase, its time we go online
      - before we do that, look at other similar apps, flush our your UI, make sure its smooth,
        - for ex that annoying white bar at top of screen should go AWAY!
